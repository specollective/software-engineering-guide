# Data Structures and Representation

Computer programs operate on data. Before a program can process data, the data must be expressed and organized within the computer. Data structures can be understood as computer representations of data. A data structure encapsulates a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the operations that can be applied to the data. Data structures are used in almost every program. Computer systems, compilers, programming languages, and software products all depend on data structures to efficiently store and organize data. There are many types of data structures, each suitable for different applications. Understanding data structures is essential to computer programming, algorithm design, and software development.
