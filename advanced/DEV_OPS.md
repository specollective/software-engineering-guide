# DevOps

Welcome to the world of DevOps, a dynamic and evolving field that sits at the crossroads of software development and operations. This guide is tailored for those who have some experience in software engineering or programming and are curious about deploying and managing distributed systems more efficiently and effectively. DevOps is not just a set of practices but a culture and philosophy that's reshaping how organizations approach software development and deployment.

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is an amalgamation of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that enhance an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at a high velocity. This approach contrasts significantly with traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. The core value of DevOps lies in its ability to enable faster, more efficient product iterations, thereby providing a competitive edge and improved service to customers.

## How DevOps Works

### Breaking Down Silos

In a traditional software development environment, development and operations teams often work in isolation, leading to bottlenecks and slow response times. DevOps breaks down these silos by either merging these teams or fostering close collaboration between them. This integrated approach covers the entire application lifecycle, from development, testing, and deployment, to operations, encouraging a broad skill set across the teams.

### Integration of QA and Security

Quality Assurance (QA) and security are integral parts of the DevOps model. Often, these functions are tightly woven into the development and operations processes, leading to a more proactive approach to security, sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.

### Automation and Tooling

DevOps heavily relies on automating manual processes and utilizing a stack of technologies and tools that aid in the rapid and reliable evolution of applications. This automation extends to tasks like code deployment and infrastructure provisioning, allowing engineers to perform these tasks independently, further increasing team velocity.
