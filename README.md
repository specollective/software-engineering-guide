# Software Engineering Guide

The Software Engineering Guide (SWEG) is an open repository of software engineering knowledge. The SWEG is designed to be a practical framework for developing a comprehensive understanding of software engineering and modern software development. The guide includes practical guidance for self-directed learning, career training, and professional development.
