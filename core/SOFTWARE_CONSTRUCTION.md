# Software Construction

This section focuses on the software construction process which encapsulates the creation of working software through programming, verification, testing, and debugging. The software construction process uses the design output and provides an input to testing. The boundaries between design, construction, and testing varies depending on your project's software life cycle and processes. While detailed design may be performed prior to construction, in practice much of software design is performed during construction activities.
